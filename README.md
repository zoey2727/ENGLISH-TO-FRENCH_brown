# ENGLISH-TO-FRENCH_brown 
On 15 July 2025, during the second week of Brown University’s Pre‑College course Neural Networks and Deep Learning, I completed Simple‑Translator, my first end‑to‑end machine‑learning project. The development workflow began with installing Python 3.11 and configuring Visual Studio Code, followed by the creation of an isolated virtual environment to maintain reproducible dependencies. I then installed the required libraries—TensorFlow, NumPy, and Keras—using pip. This step surfaced several dependency conflicts: the default TensorFlow wheel initially targeted an incompatible build of macOS, and an SSL certificate issue interrupted the dataset download. Resolving these challenges involved selecting the compatible CPU‑only wheel and programmatically overriding the SSL context to permit secure retrieval of the data.

With the environment stable, I tokenized Udacity’s small_vocab parallel corpus, built a single‑layer GRU encoder‑decoder with word embeddings, and iteratively addressed runtime issues such as tensor‑shape mismatches and the notorious NoneType model reference resulting from an omitted return statement. The design goal was a demonstration that could train quickly on a standard MacBook; therefore, the dataset remained intentionally small. While this keeps training time under one minute on a laptop CPU, it also limits vocabulary coverage, so English words absent from the corpus cannot be translated and are silently dropped by the model.

Despite these constraints, the project now offers a functional command‑line interface—python -m src.translate "he drives a blue car"—that produces French output in real time. Simple‑Translator thus serves both as a concise reference implementation for beginners and as a record of my initial experience installing tools, configuring environments, troubleshooting dependencies, and deploying a neural machine‑translation pipeline.
